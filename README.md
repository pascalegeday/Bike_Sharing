# Summary 
After completing this analysis it is evident that future investors and business owners alike, should be paying attention to certain user trends. Below I have highlighted key trends and how these trends can prove beneficial to improving business. 


Male subscribers who most likely hold a 9-5 job in NYC are Citi Bike's most frequent customers.
* Ads and marketing can be targeted to professionals

Monday-Friday before 10am and after 4pm are when users are most likely to use Citi Bikes.
* This information can be used to decipher when repairs can be done to bikes.
* Also, noting that professionals use bikes as a means of transportation to their jobs

User trips are only five to twenty minutes long. 
* This provides insight to the amount of damage or wear that can come to the bikes. 
* Also, on average, users aren't travelling very long distances at a time

Females are less likely to use Citi Bikes as a means of transportation 
* Conduct focus groups to figure out how Citi Bike or similar businesses can increase female users. 


Finally, for further insight it could prove helpful to perform two additional visualizations: 
* Determine which are the top 5-10 starting stations and top 5-10 ending stations to determine whether there are sufficient bikes at each station and whether the bikes at these stations will most likely need the most repairs. 

* Determine which are the bottom 5-10 starting stations and bottom 5-10 ending stations to determine whether the business may be losing money in keeping that many bikes at each stations.
